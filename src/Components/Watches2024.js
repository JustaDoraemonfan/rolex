The Oyster Perpetual Submariner was, at its launch in 1953, the first diversâ€™ wristwatch to be waterproof to 100 metres (330 feet). Today, at the forefront of watchmaking technology, the Submariner and the Submariner Date are equipped with features that ensure their reliability and trustworthiness as diving instruments. Much like those who venture boldly into the mysterious ocean depths, many wearers have chosen the Submariner to explore different territories.
